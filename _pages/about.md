This is the beggining of my personal Website.
For now most of it orgininates from the template and I only customized some minor things

I don't really have a clue how this will develop but I plan to write some blogposts about some topics that I haven't found explained well enough.

I also haven't written any posts yet, but when I do you can find them here:
[C++](https://julianeiler.github.io/cpp) and [Tensorflow](https://julianeiler.github.io/tensorflow)

Here you can find a map of all the places I traveled:
